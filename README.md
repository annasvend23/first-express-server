# First express server

## Version 3.0.2

This project was created to demonstrate my express.js and mongoDB skills.
I've implemented the creation of unique users, authentication, authorization, updating user information. Also, the user can create and delete their own cards, set and delete likes to cards.

**Technologies**: JavaScript, GIT, Node.js, express.js, mongoDB, mongoose

### Setup

1. git clone *https://github.com/annasvend23/first-express-server.git*;
2. `npm inslall`;
3. `npm run dev` - this would start server in watch mode;
